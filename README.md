# Purpose

These are just some practice I'm doing to improve my algorithms and data structures knowledge. Implementations in various languages, though I will favor C/C++ and Python. Might try some assembly because it sounds fun.

# Subsections

## Array

A basic array. Written in C. Uses a struct containing a pointer to an array and the length since for integer arrays it is nice to atleast have length. Included simple methods for inserting, removing, showing, sorting, and setting array values.

## Stack

A stack implemented in C. Uses a struct containing a pointer to memory used, height, and capacity. Includes simple methods, e.g. pop and push, as well as derived methods (not relying on the underlying array, but the stack itself) in particular there will be a sorting algorithm which uses the `disk game` method of sorting.
